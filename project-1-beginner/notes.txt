- In this chapter we will learn using the docs; https://vuejs.org/
- In VueJS, you are either structuring your code using the Options API or the Composition API. In this repository we will mainly use the Composition API
but the result of the code that will be executed will be the same. 
- Also take your time to rewrite the code from Composition API to Options API in your own time to master the framework. 

- We will learn the following concepts:
1. Vue Installation with a CDN link; <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js"></script>
2. Making vue alive & reactive.
3. Computed properties.
4. Conditional CSS classes.
5. Input binding.

Install the Live Server extension on your VS Code to view your code changes on the go.
